# Solana Validator running on AWS

This example brings up a single Solana validator on AWS.  This is a
non-voting functional example, and shouldn't used for any production
use case.  You may have performance problems with the default
`node:instanceType`.

## Pulumi Configuration Options

| Name              | Description                                                       | Default Value |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| solana:network    | The known Solana cluster to connect to.                           | testnet       |
| node:instanceType | The AWS instance type to use for all of the nodes.                | t3.2xlarge    |

## Running the Example

0. Have `pulumi` installed, logged in to wherever you're storing state, and configured to work with AWS.

- https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_login/
- https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration

1. Run `pulumi install`; this will install all of the required pieces for this example.

```
% pulumi install
Installing dependencies...

yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
[2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
[3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
[4/4] üî®  Building fresh packages...
‚ú®  Done in 3.69s.

```

2. Create and select a Pulumi stack

```
% pulumi stack init new-validator
Created stack 'new-validator'
```

3. Run `pulumi up`

```
% pulumi up
Previewing update (new-validator)

Resources:

Duration: 1m2s
```

4. Verify that the validator has connected to the network.

```
% ./ssh-to-host tail -f /home/sol/logs

```

5. You can then do some of the following by manually:

- Airdrop Solana to your validator's accounts.
- Create a vote account for your validator.
- Create stake for your validator.

Please see the [Solana Operations](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/) manual for more information.
To SSH into the validator node you just created, run `./ssh-to-host` with no arguments.

6. (Optional) Tear down the example

```
% pulumi down
```
