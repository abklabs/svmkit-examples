# SVMKit Examples

Welcome to the **SVMKit Examples** repository! This collection of examples is designed to help developers gain a deeper understanding of **SVMKit** and explore ways to integrate it into various workflows.

## About This Repository

This repository acts as a central hub for examples of how to use [SVMKit](https://github.com/abklabs/svmkit?tab=readme-ov-file#svmkit) to build both simple and complex Solana installations with ease. Here, you’ll find a range of example implementations, each demonstrating essential concepts and methods for utilizing **SVMKit**. While this repository does not cover every possible use case, the examples provided aim to serve as a solid foundation for getting started and exploring custom applications with SVMKit.

Here are some examples of how to use SVMKit in various scenarios:

## Examples

- Setting up a Solana Permissioned Environment [(SPE) on AWS](https://github.com/abklabs/svmkit-examples/tree/main/aws-network-spe-py)
- Setting up a Validator to join [testnet](https://github.com/abklabs/pulumi-svmkit/tree/main/examples) - this is an example for developers hacking on the codebase - we'll add an example for node operators soon.
