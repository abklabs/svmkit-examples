# X1 Validator running on AWS

This example deploys a single X1 testnet validator on AWS. It is a non-voting, functional demonstration and is not intended for production use. For the additional instructions needed to setup a voting validator, please refer to the official [X1 documentation](https://docs.x1.xyz/validating/create-a-validator-node).

| node:instanceArch   | The AWS architecture type to use for AMI lookup.                  | x86\_64       |
| node:volumeIOPS     | The number of IOPS to provide to the ledger and accounts volumes. | 5000          |
| node:rootVolumeSize | The size of the AWS instance's root volume, in gigabytes.         | 32            |
| node:instanceAmi    | The AMI to use for all of the nodes.                              | _(debian-12)_ |

### Performance testing

 The default configuration for IOPS is targeted at functional testing.
 For perfomance testing, set node:volumeIOPS to 16000.

## Running the Example

0. Have `pulumi` installed, logged in to wherever you're storing state, and configured to work with AWS.

- https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_login/
- https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration

1. Run `pulumi install`; this will install all of the required pieces for this example.

```
% pulumi install
Installing dependencies...

yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
[2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
[3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
[4/4] üî®  Building fresh packages...
‚ú®  Done in 3.69s.
Finished installing dependencies
```

2. Create and select a Pulumi stack

```
% pulumi stack init new-validator
Created stack 'new-validator'
```

3. Run `pulumi up`

```
% pulumi up
Previewing update (new-validator)

.
.
.

Do you want to perform this update? yes
Updating (new-validator)

    SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: [secret]

Resources:

Duration: 1m2s
```

4. Verify that the validator has connected to the network.

```
% ./ssh-to-host 0 journalctl -f -u svmkit-tachyon-validator
[2024-11-20T17:50:24.275774661Z INFO  solana_download_utils] downloaded 3048373992 bytes 9.3% 17468680.0 bytes/s

```

5. You can then do some of the following by manually:

- Airdrop Solana to your validator's accounts.
- Create a vote account for your validator.
- Create stake for your validator.

To SSH into the validator node you just created, run `./ssh-to-host 0` with no additional arguments.

6. (Optional) Tear down the example

```
% pulumi down
```
